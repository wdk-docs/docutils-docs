"Python lends itself to inline documentation.  With its built-in docstring"
" syntax, a limited form of `Literate Programming`_ is easy to do in "
"Python.  However, there are no satisfactory standard tools for extracting"
" and processing Python docstrings.  The lack of a standard toolset is a "
"significant gap in Python's infrastructure; this PEP aims to fill the "
"gap."

"The issues surrounding docstring processing have been contentious and "
"difficult to resolve.  This PEP proposes a generic Docstring Processing "
"System (DPS) framework, which separates out the components (program and "
"conceptual), enabling the resolution of individual issues either through "
"consensus (one solution) or through divergence (many). It promotes "
"standard interfaces which will allow a variety of plug-in components "
"(input context readers, markup parsers, and output format writers) to be "
"used."

"These systems, each with different goals, have had varying degrees of "

"combined with inflexibility.  They provided a self-contained set of "
"components: a docstring extraction system, a markup parser, an internal "
"processing system and one or more output format writers with a fixed "
"style.  Inevitably, one or more aspects of each system had serious "

"It has become clear (to this author, at least) that the \"all or "

"system could possibly be agreed upon by all interested parties.  A "
"modular component approach designed for extension, where components may "
"be multiply implemented, may be the only chance for success. Standard "

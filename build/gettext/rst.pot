msgid "reStructuredText is an easy-to-read, what-you-see-is-what-you-get plaintext markup syntax and parser system.  It is useful for in-line program documentation (such as Python docstrings), for quickly creating simple web pages, and for standalone documents. reStructuredText is designed for extensibility for specific application domains.  The reStructuredText parser is a component of Docutils_.  reStructuredText is a revision and reinterpretation of the StructuredText_ and Setext_ lightweight markup systems."

msgid "The primary goal of reStructuredText is to define and implement a markup syntax for use in Python docstrings and other documentation domains, that is readable and simple, yet powerful enough for non-trivial use.  The intended purpose of the markup is the conversion of reStructuredText documents into useful structured data formats."
